# 🛠️ Tools Need Love


Tools Need Love is a Minecraft mod that adds realistic wear, rust, and degradation to iron tools and armor.
Your gear doesn’t stay pristine forever — if you use it, it shows.

This mod is designed to feel immersive, balanced, and vanilla-friendly, while laying the groundwork for much deeper systems in the future.

# ⚙️ Current Features



🪓 Tool & Armor Wear System

Iron tools and armor degrade over time

Usage and damage cause items to become:

🟤 Worn ✅

🔩 Rusted 



Visual and functional progression makes equipment feel earned, not disposable


# 🌧️ Planned Features (In Development)

(🌍 Climate-Based Rust System)


In future versions, rust will no longer be tied to simple usage alone.

Planned mechanics include:

☔ Rain exposure


🌫️ High-humidity or damp biomes


🏞️ Climate-aware degradation instead of flat durability loss
