🛠️ Tools Need Love

Tools Need Love is a Minecraft mod that adds realistic wear, rust, and degradation to iron tools and armor.
Your gear doesn’t stay pristine forever — if you use it, it shows.

This mod is designed to feel immersive, balanced, and vanilla-friendly, while laying the groundwork for much deeper systems in the future.

⚙️ Current Features
🪓 Tool & Armor Wear System

Iron tools and armor degrade over time

Usage and damage cause items to become:

🟤 Worn

🔩 Rusted

Visual and functional progression makes equipment feel earned, not disposable

🧱 Vanilla-Friendly Design

No overcomplicated mechanics

No forced micromanagement

Fits naturally into survival gameplay

🌧️ Planned Features (In Development)
🌍 Climate-Based Rust System

In future versions, rust will no longer be tied to simple usage alone.

Planned mechanics include:

☔ Rain exposure

🌫️ High-humidity or damp biomes

🏞️ Climate-aware degradation instead of flat durability loss

This means:

Tools won’t rust just from mining in a desert

Leaving iron gear exposed in wet environments will matter

Storage and environment become meaningful gameplay decisions

🔮 Long-Term Vision

More realistic equipment behavior

Deeper immersion without turning Minecraft into a chore

Expandable framework for additional materials and mechanics
